Minecraft has an API for python in order to let players to create their world more innovatively with python language.I have a chance to teach several pupils and secondary school students to learn programming through minecraft.These codes are the examples I used in teaching.Most codes based on two books:Adventures in Minecraft & Learn to program with minecraft.

These is a python module named turtle,which is just like turbo turtle but written by python.It alows children to use a 'turtle' to draw pictures.Most of them are geometric graphics ,based on repetations and other common programming structures.Some of the codes in this repository is based on module 'turtle' and it is  preinstalled in python 2.7 and python 3.5(I used those two versions in teaching).
